"""Sub-cell decode of RampNet heatmap peaks (issue #221).

Why this exists
---------------
The pano model's head is ``Conv(3x3) -> ReLU -> Upsample(bilinear, x8) -> Conv(1x1)``
on a stride-32 ConvNeXt feature map. The 1x1 conv is linear (and its bias commutes with
bilinear resampling, whose weights sum to one), so the 512x1024 heatmap is *exactly* a
bilinear upsample of a 64x128 map -- the "coarse" map. A bilinear surface peaks only at
its sample points, so an integer argmax can only land on the two hi-res pixels that
flank a coarse centre (``8i+3`` / ``8i+4`` under ``align_corners=False``). Detections are
therefore quantized to an 8-pixel grid (2.8 deg of heading and of dip on a 4096-wide
pano). The crop model has the same head and the same x8 factor.

The sub-cell position is still present in the coarse neighbourhood of the peak, so it
can be recovered at inference without retraining. This module does that:

- :func:`coarse_from_heatmap` recovers the coarse map from a 512x1024 heatmap (exact up
  to float error, by least squares against the bilinear operator), so a caller that only
  has ``model(x)`` -- such as the auto-labeler -- does not need to hook the head.
- :func:`refine_offset` turns the 3x3 coarse neighbourhood of a peak into a sub-cell
  offset, by one of several standard rules (``METHODS``).
- :func:`refine_peaks` refines peaks you already have: peaks as returned by
  ``peak_local_max`` on the heatmap in, refined normalized ``(x, y)`` out.
- :func:`detect_peaks` is the shipped entry point (#221 items 1-2): heatmap in,
  ``(row, col, score)`` out, with ``decode="argmax"`` (the published behaviour,
  bit-identical to the bare ``peak_local_max`` call) or ``decode="gaussian"``. It is
  what ``stage_two/evaluate.py``, ``stage_two/demo.py`` and the Hugging Face package's
  ``RampNetModel.detect`` call. This file is shipped verbatim to the Hub as
  ``rampnet_subcell.py``, so it must import nothing beyond numpy (scikit-image is
  imported lazily, inside ``detect_peaks``).

Coordinates follow the pipeline's existing convention (``stage_two/train.py`` places a
target at pixel ``round(x_norm * W)``; every extractor reports ``x_norm = col / W``), so
a hi-res pixel index ``p`` is the normalized position ``p / W`` and coarse centre ``i``
sits at hi-res index ``f*i + (f-1)/2`` (``8i + 3.5``). An argmax at ``8i+3`` or ``8i+4``
is therefore half a hi-res pixel either side of the coarse centre it belongs to.

Pure numpy, no torch. Usage::

    from rampnet.subcell import detect_peaks
    # h: raw (unclipped) single-pass 512x1024 head output
    rcs = detect_peaks(h, 0.3, decode="gaussian", clip=True)   # (N, 3) row, col, score
    x_norm, y_norm = rcs[:, 1] / h.shape[1], rcs[:, 0] / h.shape[0]

or, with peaks already in hand::

    from rampnet.subcell import refine_peaks
    from skimage.feature import peak_local_max
    pk = peak_local_max(np.clip(h, 0, 1), min_distance=10, threshold_abs=0.3,
                        exclude_border=False)
    xy = refine_peaks(h, pk, method="gaussian")   # (N, 2) normalized x, y

    - ``decode="argmax"`` returns those pixels unchanged, so it is bit-identical to the

    heatmap -- any shape that is a multiple of ``factor`` works). It must be the coarse

    - ``coarse=None``: recovered from ``heatmap`` itself (:func:`coarse_from_heatmap`).
      Exact only when ``heatmap`` is unclipped. To find peaks on ``clip(h, 0, 1)`` the
      way every extractor in this repo does while decoding from the raw ``h``, pass the
      raw map with ``clip=True``.
    - ``coarse=<(h, w) array>``: used directly.
    - ``coarse=<(B, h, w) stack>``: one coarse map per branch of a flip-TTA max-combine
      (each already oriented like ``heatmap``). Each peak is decoded from the branch
      whose upsampled value is highest at that pixel, i.e. the branch the elementwise
      max took it from. Measured on manual_gold under flip TTA in
      ``docs/decode_e2e_221.md``: mean error to the box centres 5.066 -> 4.366 px.

    ``wrap_x`` is passed to :func:`refine_peaks` (default off, as measured: the network
    pads the 360 deg seam rather than wrapping). It must stay off for the crop model.
    ``exclude_border`` defaults to False, the #132 fix. ``return_pixels=True`` also
    returns the ``(N, 2)`` integer ``(row, col)`` pixels, so a caller can read the score
    in the heatmap's own dtype.

    With a refining decode and ``coarse=None``, the heatmap is checked first: if it is
    not an exact x``factor`` bilinear upsample (relative residual above
    :data:`UPSAMPLE_RTOL` -- e.g. it was clipped, TTA-combined, or came from an input
    size other than the model's), this **raises** ``ValueError`` rather than decode from
