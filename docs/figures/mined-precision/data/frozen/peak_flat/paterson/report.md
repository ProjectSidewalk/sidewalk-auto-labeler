## paterson: precision of mined positives (RampNet#158 step 1)

run: 34687 panos -> 13174 sites, 5029 with >= 3 operational panos
GT: 125 fully judged panos, 125 with the missed-ramp check attested; match radius 5 m; candidates within 15 m; camera height per-pano
excluded: 4 (site, pano) pairs where the pano is a member through a sub-threshold detection only

camera-height resolution (#56):
- camera height mode `per-pano`
- 30325 of 34687 panos took a measured height; 4362 fell back to the 2.6 m constant
- flagged by the #44 QC gate (kept all the same): {'flagged_qc:vintage_deviation': 484}
- 30325 heights read from depth/index.csv; spread definition: measured_planes_only

placement: peak_flat -- 1 of 27 candidates placed by the arm, 0 fell back and 0 did not reach the ground (both keep the flat projection of the site); median shift of a placed target from the site 2.93 m. Candidates, ranges and strata are the flat run's, so this is paired candidate by candidate with it. 26 candidates were NOT EMITTED by the placement's target definition and are in neither denominator.

Two denominators (see the module docstring). A miner has no verdicts, so it cannot filter `already_detected` out; those labels ship and they are correct.

- **hard-only** (new misses): 0.000 [0.00, 0.79] (n=1) -> read at <= 15 m: drop this label source; the 95% CI [0.00, 0.79] spans the drop/visibility bands, so this is not decisive
- **all-mined** (correct labels): 0.000 [0.00, 0.79] (n=1) -> read at <= 15 m: drop this label source; the 95% CI [0.00, 0.79] spans the drop/visibility bands, so this is not decisive

### by site support (operational panos)

### by best member confidence

| stratum | cand. | tp | fp | of which rej. det. | already det. | unsure | unadj. | precision hard-only [95% CI] | precision all-mined [95% CI] |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|---|
| best member >= 0.9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | n/a | n/a |
| best member < 0.9 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000 [0.00, 0.79] (n=1) | 0.000 [0.00, 0.79] (n=1) |

Read the confidence split with care: `best_conf` saturates (values run above 1.0), so the >= 0.9 bin holds most candidates, and it is confounded with support and range - stronger sites are seen by more panos, hence from further away, where precision falls for geometric reasons. It is not evidence that confident sites mine worse.

### mined yield over the whole run (#102 sanity check)

An upper bound: these are (strong site, non-member pano) pairs, and the `already_detected` column above shows a share of them are ramps the model already detects from that pano rather than misses.

| radius | (site, non-member pano) pairs | x operational detections |
|---|--:|--:|
| <= 10 m | 793 | 0.03x |
| <= 15 m | 2998 | 0.10x |
